A HEx Helper to edit bytes by the nibble.

Do --help for more information.";

const LONG_ABOUT: &str = "
The HEx Helper is a terminal tool used for modifying binaries by
the nibble. It aims to replicate some of the look of hexyl while
functionaly acting like a terminal UI version of GHex.

Note that the octal and hexadecimal labels are slightly
different in heh; they interpret the stream as if 0s were filled
to the end of the byte (i.e. stream length 9 on FF FF would
produce octal 377 200 and hexadecimal FF 80).

Like GHex, you cannot create files with heh, only modify them.

Terminal UI Commands:
    ALT=                Increase the stream length by 1
    ALT-                Decrease the stream length by 1
    CNTRLs              Save
    CNTRLq              Quit
    CNTRLj              Jump to Byte

Left-clicking on a label will copy the contents to the clipboard.
Left-clicking on the ASCII or hex table will focus it.

Zooming in and out will change the size of the components.";
