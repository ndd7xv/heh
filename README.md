The HEx Helper is a cross-platform terminal UI used for modifying file data in hex or ASCII. It aims to replicate some of the look of hexyl while functionally acting like a terminal UI version of GHex.

__heh is currently in alpha - it's not ready to be used in any production manner. Notably, it does not store backups if killed or crashing and there is no undo option after deleting a byte.__
