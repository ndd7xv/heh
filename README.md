# heh

The HEx Helper is a cross-platform terminal UI used for modifying file data in hex or ASCII. It aims to replicate some of the look of hexyl while functionaly acting like a terminal UI version of GHex.

__heh is currently in alpha - it's not ready to be used in any production manner. Notably, it does not store backups if killed or crashing and there is no undo option after deleting a byte.__

# Installation and Usage

heh is currently only available via cargo:

```

From `heh --help`:
```
...
Terminal UI Commands:
    ALT=                Increase the stream length by 1
    ALT-                Decrease the stream length by 1
    CNTRLs              Save
    CNTRLq              Quit
    CNTRLj              Jump to Byte

Left-clicking on a label will copy the contents to the clipboard.
Left-clicking on the ASCII or hex table will focus it.

Zooming in and out will change the size of the components.
